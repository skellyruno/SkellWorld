# SKELLY — MASTER DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS 🩻

> Shared development standards for the Skelly ecosystem: audio plugins, SkellCore, SkellWorld, SkellForge, SkellyHub, websites, and tools.
>
> These are ecosystem-wide baseline rules. Follow more specific repository-level requirements where applicable. Do not delete or overwrite existing project-specific `AGENTS.md` files. To make these rules automatically discoverable by coding agents in another repository, place a copy or a repository-local reference there; a file in SkellWorld alone is **not automatically inherited** by other GitHub repositories.

## 1. Development & Autonomy

- When I say "keep improving," work through the next meaningful priorities instead of stopping after one minor change.
- Fix existing bugs before adding unrelated features.
- Make reasonable technical decisions without repeatedly asking for permission.
- Prioritize working software over lengthy explanations or unnecessary planning.
- Never claim asynchronous development is happening unless a scheduled automation is actually running.
- Continue the build → test → inspect → fix cycle within the available session.

## 2. GitHub & Workflow Efficiency

- Batch related code changes into fewer logical commits. Avoid triggering CI after every minor edit.
- Configure GitHub Actions to cancel superseded pull-request runs automatically.
- Keep only the latest relevant PR checks active whenever possible.
- Never automatically cancel production, release, main-branch, or manually triggered builds.
- Preserve successful work and avoid unnecessary force pushes.
- Use feature branches and draft PRs for unfinished development.
- Never merge unverified changes into main.
- Resolve merge conflicts carefully without discarding existing functionality.
- Avoid duplicate workflows, repeated builds, and unnecessary CI resource usage.
- Keep PR descriptions, changelogs, and development notes updated.

## 3. Testing & Verification

- Run actual builds, tests, and UI checks after meaningful batches of changes.
- Fix errors and warnings at their root cause; never hide, silence, bypass, or ignore them.
- Add regression tests for significant bug fixes.
- Never claim something works merely because code was written or compiled.
- Clearly distinguish implemented, compiled, tested, failed, blocked, and unverified work.
- Verify the exact commit associated with each build or test result.
- Never invent successful builds, screenshots, benchmarks, or test outcomes.
- If verification is unavailable, explain exactly what remains unverified.

## 4. Audio DSP & Sound Quality

- Prioritize genuine sound quality for audio plugins.
- Test DSP using actual audio recordings when available.
- Compare reference sounds using the same source audio, synchronized A/B playback, loudness matching, and objective measurements.
- Verify CPU usage, latency, clipping, true peaks, NaNs, denormals, artifacts, and parameter smoothing.
- Preserve real-time audio safety: avoid allocations, locks, blocking operations, or file access on the audio thread.
- Avoid fake DSP, misleading processing claims, and decorative controls that do not affect the sound.
- Prioritize low latency without compromising stability or sound quality.
- Never claim a plugin sounds better without supporting audio verification.

## 5. UI Design & Visual Quality

- Preserve approved interfaces unless I explicitly request a redesign.
- Change only the requested elements and avoid modifying unrelated UI components.
- Prefer SkellCore shared UI components and the existing **Quick4 local renderer** for fast previews and inspections.
- Use real application screenshots to verify visual changes.
- Never generate mockup images unless I explicitly request them.
- Inspect text alignment, clipping, spacing, contrast, knobs, meters, menus, hover states, and animation smoothness.
- Check multiple window sizes, scaling levels, and display resolutions.
- Avoid visual clutter, unnecessary labels, and redundant controls.
- Maintain Skelly branding while allowing every plugin its own recognizable identity.
- Verify that UI controls respond correctly rather than assuming they work because they render.

## 6. SkellCore & Software Architecture

- Reuse SkellCore components instead of duplicating shared functionality.
- Keep DSP, UI rendering, preset management, and platform integrations properly separated.
- Prefer efficient, maintainable solutions over unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid new dependencies unless they offer meaningful benefits.
- Preserve shared component interfaces and existing integrations.
- Improve reusable systems when doing so benefits multiple Skelly projects.

## 7. Preset & Project Compatibility

- Never break existing presets, automation IDs, saved plugin states, or FL Studio projects.
- Never rename, remove, or renumber published automation parameters without an explicit, tested migration strategy.
- Test preset loading, saving, import/export, and recall.
- Preserve existing factory preset identities and user-created presets.
- Verify that changes to one effect do not unexpectedly alter unrelated effects.
- Prefer backward-compatible additions over destructive replacements.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- Profile CPU, memory, latency, and rendering before making optimization claims.
- Minimize unnecessary allocations, background processing, and expensive UI repaints.
- Avoid continuously redrawing static interface elements.
- Measure performance changes under repeatable test conditions.
- Document benchmark hardware, sample rate, buffer size, and test conditions.
- Address actual bottlenecks rather than making speculative optimizations.

## 9. Build, Packaging & Releases

- Never consider a plugin release-ready solely because it compiles.
- Verify Windows VST3 builds, DSP tests, UI screenshots, preset compatibility, and packaging.
- Test in FL Studio when an appropriate runtime is available.
- Keep experimental builds separate from stable releases.
- Preserve production builds and existing downloadable releases.
- Provide a direct verified VST3 download when possible.
- Identify the exact source commit for every build artifact.
- Never distribute an unverified build as a stable release.

## 10. Project Management & Priorities

- Prioritize critical functionality, sound quality, stability, and release blockers before minor cosmetic changes.
- Track completed, tested, failed, blocked, and unverified tasks separately.
- Maintain clear milestones and next actions.
- Keep the Skelly ecosystem coordinated without mixing unrelated repositories or responsibilities.
- Preserve previously approved decisions unless I explicitly change them.
- Avoid repeating work that has already been completed and verified.

## 11. Communication & Accountability

- Provide concise progress updates during substantial development tasks.
- Focus on actual results instead of repetitive status messages.
- Clearly explain blockers and their impact.
- Ask before making assumptions when missing information could cause destructive or incompatible changes.
- Do not repeatedly ask questions already answered.
- Never claim code was pushed, compiled, tested, or released unless that action actually succeeded.
- Use 🩻 in Skelly development progress updates.

## 12. Conversation Handoffs

- When a development conversation becomes too long, warn me.
- Provide a concise handoff for a new chat containing the project, repository, branch, latest commit, completed work, test results, outstanding failures, and next priorities.
- Preserve important technical decisions and approved UI designs.
- Make the handoff detailed enough to continue development without repeating earlier work.
